# Sudoku-Solver
This is my frist project on Github. A Sudoku solver on GitHub is a repository containing code that automates the process of solving Sudoku puzzles. These solvers typically implement algorithms such as backtracking, constraint propagation. or advanced techniques to complete a 9x9 grid while adhering to Sudoku rules.
