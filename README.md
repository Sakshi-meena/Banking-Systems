This GitHub repository showcases a C++ banking system that exemplifies Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The project features a `Bank` class designed to manage multiple `Account` objects. It supports essential banking operations including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and displaying account details. Through an interactive menu, users can easily perform transactions and view account information, making the system both practical and intuitive. This repository offers a clear and maintainable example of how to implement a basic banking system using OOP concepts, providing a solid foundation for further development or learning.
